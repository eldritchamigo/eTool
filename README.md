<h1> eSignature Tool</h1>
<p> The purpose for this tool is to explore HTML & Javascript. While I am unfamiliar with both languages, I am excited to create a tool that has practical applications in my day-to-day. </p>

<p> Desired outcome would be to create a webpage where users can input employee information, click submit & an eSignature is created; the eSignature would either be a string of text or HTML that can be copied & pasted onto the Outlook email signature insert. </p>

<p>example:</p>
